        <h4> Motivational quote to motivate my gal</h4>
        <p class="color"> It's about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward; how much you can take and keep moving forward.
        <p class="color">That's how winning is done! Now, if you know what you're worth, then go out and get what you're worth. </p>
        <p class="color">But you gotta be willing to take the hits, and not pointing fingers</p> <p class="color">saying you ain't where you wanna be because of him, or her, or anybody. Cowards do that and that ain't you. You're better than that!</p> 
        <p class="color">I'm always gonna love you, no matter what</p>
